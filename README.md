Basic Characteristics of Swarm Intelligence
Swarm Intelligence (SI) refers to the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, typically inspired by nature, such as ant colonies, bird flocking, and fish schooling. It focuses on how simple agents (individuals) interact locally and collectively to solve complex problems. Here are the main characteristics of SI:

Emergent Behavior:
Complex global behavior arises from the interactions of simple local agents. These behaviors cannot be predicted from individual actions but emerge as a result of the collective effort. For example, ants in a colony collectively find the shortest path to food, even though each ant only follows simple rules.
Self-Organization:
Agents can organize themselves into efficient structures or patterns without any centralized control. Through local interactions, like following simple rules, agents cooperate to form effective solutions. This can be seen in how ants build nests or bees construct honeycombs.
Adaptation:
SI systems are capable of adapting to changes in the environment. Agents can modify their behavior based on the surroundings, allowing the system to be flexible and robust. For instance, ants can find new food sources if the previous ones are depleted.
Decentralized Control:
There is no central leader or control unit. Instead, all agents act based on local information. This is different from traditional systems where decisions are made by a central authority. In SI, the system works as a collective, with each agent making decisions based on its environment.
Scalability:
SI systems are often highly scalable, meaning that adding more agents (like more ants or robots) does not reduce system performance. In fact, more agents can improve the efficiency of the overall system, as seen in how larger colonies of ants can cover more area in search of food.
